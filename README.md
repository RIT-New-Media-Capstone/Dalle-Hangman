# Overview
[Temp]
Dalle-Wordle is an application that seamlessly merges the capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E. This unique program allows users to choose their preferred difficulty level, prompting OpenAI to generate a thought-provoking word prompt. This prompt is then transformed into a visually stunning image by DALL-E. The challenge? Users must decipher the original prompt by ChatGPT based solely on the generated image, letter by letter.
